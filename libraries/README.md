## What are Libraries?

A library is pre-made code created by someone else that you can use in your project to enhance certain features. Libraries can make your project more efficient and easier to develop.

## Usage

To use a library in your Korvaqscrip project, include it at the beginning of your .kq file like this:

```korvaq
connect "path/to/the/library.kq"
```
