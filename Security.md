# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at **KorvaqScrip**. If you discover a security vulnerability in our software, we encourage you to report it promptly so we can address it. Please follow these steps:

1. **Identify the Issue**: Gather as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it, the severity, and any relevant code snippets.

2. **Do Not Post Publicly**: Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until it has been addressed, as this could put users at risk.

3. **Create an Issue**: Open a new issue in our GitHub repository and label it as "security." Include a brief description of the vulnerability and any relevant information.

4. **Be Patient**: We will review the report and work on a fix as soon as possible. We appreciate your understanding and cooperation.

## Our Commitment

- We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
- We will keep you updated on the progress of the investigation and resolution.
- Once the vulnerability has been fixed, we will credit you in our release notes unless you prefer to remain anonymous.

## Best Practices for Security

To ensure the security of your projects made with KorvaqScrip, we recommend the following best practices:

1. **Keep Your Dependencies Updated**: Regularly check and update any libraries or dependencies to their latest versions.
2. **Review Code Changes**: Conduct thorough reviews of any code changes, especially those that affect security-sensitive areas.
3. **Use Environment Variables**: Avoid hardcoding sensitive information like API keys or passwords in your code. Use environment variables instead.
4. **Implement Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs to protect against common vulnerabilities such as injection attacks.
